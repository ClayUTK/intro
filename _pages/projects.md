# 1. Key technologies of digital power grid
* **time**: 2020.12-2023.9
* **role**: I mainly took part in the second sub-project: the development of edge computing devices toward multi-service collaboration in digital power grid. I am responsibile for the research about massive data compression and its deployment on edge computing devices to alleviate the burden of communication systems.
* **finding**: I proposed a real-time data compression method, including predicion, quantization and bitpack. Please refer to [this paper](https://github.com/ClayUTK/intro/blob/358e661b271cfcca502c813e681e024cb3b3c0ac/_publications/Real-Time_D-PMU_Data_Compression_for_Edge_Computing_Devices_in_Digital_Distribution_Networks.pdf) to get more details.

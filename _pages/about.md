Hello, I am Jiahui (Clay) Yang, a PhD researcher in Electrical Engineering at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville. My research focuses on wide-area power system monitoring, with an emphasis on PMU/FDR system design, precision timing and synchronization, and edge computing. I work on PMU hardware and embedded systems, GPS- and FPGA-based timing sources, real-time frequency and phasor estimation, and data compression for large-scale distribution networks. I am actively involved in the FNET/GridEye project and collaborative research with utility partners.
